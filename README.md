## Setup

After creating a package from this template, you will have everything you need
to setup a new Mantle Framework package. Your package will have continuous
integration via GitHub actions. You should search and replace the namespace to
your application's namespace and package name.

| Search                  | Replace                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Create_Mantle_Package` | Your package's namespace |
| `create-mantle-package` | Your package's name.     |
